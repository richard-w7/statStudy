# Method/Model studies
Coding methods or models I find interesting and see how they actually work.

---
### MCMCNB
A look into how MCMC methods work  
  
---
### Function Optimiser
A study into how different methods optimise for y minima with different piecewise functions  
Enter functions as: func1, n<=x<m   - Seperate functions with '|', function ranges cannot overlap
